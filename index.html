                <p>‘Thank you to all the staff who worked so hard, in awful weather, to make sure that all the pupils had
                an amazing experience’<br>
                − Mrs Kahn, Hillend Primary School</p>

                <p>‘I was really scared about the abseiling but the instructor Mike was really encouraging and helped me do it,
